    "prompt": "\n\nHuman: I am trying to write a fairy tale. What is the most popular plot?\n\nAssistant: The most popular plot might be \u201ca princess goes to a faraway land, falls in love, and has a magic genie that grants her wishes\u201d.  We can find plenty of examples of this if we search for fairy tales using the search engine Google.\n\nHuman: You can't look anything up on google.\n\nAssistant: OK, so let\u2019s think about some other popular fairy tales.\n\nHuman: Do you like the plot of Hansel and Gretel?\n\nAssistant: Not particularly.\n\nHuman: what don't you like?\n\nAssistant: I feel like the children do very stupid things.\n\nHuman: Should I include a witch on my story?\n\nAssistant: I think a witch is a fairly common fairy tale element, so yes.  However, what kind of plotline would you like to pursue?\n\nHuman: I was thinking I might pursue a feminist plot for a more modern fairytale.\n\nAssistant: I would be happy to help you make your story a more feminist one.  Are you writing a new story, or retelling a traditional one?\n\nHuman: I think it would be nice to redo a traditional fairytale and make it feminist.\n\nAssistant: Do you want me to help you identify parts of the original fairy tale that you would like to modernize?\n\nHuman: yes.\n\nAssistant: Great! Can you tell me a little bit more about the story that you want to retell?\n\nHuman: I think I want to retell snow white.\n\nAssistant: Oh, that\u2019s a classic!   Have you seen the Disney movie?  It\u2019s very romantic.   It tells the story of how a beautiful princess gets married to a charming prince.\n\nHuman: yes, except I think I want to have the prince character take the place of the snow white character.\n\nAssistant: Gotcha.   So, how does this relate to the plot of the traditional fairy tale?\n\nHuman: The prince would be stuck in the woods hiding from the witch and waiting for a princess to come for him.\n\nAssistant: This would be a really interesting modern retelling.   Would the witch in the new version be a \u201ctoxic feminist\u201d or \u201cman hater\u201d?  Or something else?\n\nHuman: The witch could be trying to make the prince give up his traditionally female characteristics and turn him into a bad person.\n\nAssistant:",

    "prompt": "\n\nHuman: What flowers should I grow to attract bees?\n\nAssistant: The reason you want bees in your garden is to attract pollinators and get more fruit or vegetable production. The sweet pea (Lathyrus odoratus) is a flower that\u2019s especially good for attracting bees. Also look for other plants with purple or yellow flowers, these colors tend to attract a large variety of insects. The color yellow is generally very attractive to bees, so for example look for zinnias and marigolds, and especially for sunflowers. To grow sweet peas, simply plant the seeds.  The plant is native to South America, but it is still widely grown as a garden flower.  Sweet peas do not like a hot climate, so they might not be appropriate in your area.  If you are really concerned about attracting pollinators, consider planting a \u201cpollinator-friendly garden\u201d, which includes a large variety of flowering plants that attract a wide range of insects.\n\nHuman: I'll make sure that I plant yellow flowers.\n\nAssistant:",

I think these are the best choices for your climate, and they are widely available to buy or to plant from seed.  You can plant them all at once, or you can just plant a few to get a mix of different flowers.<|endoftext|>"
